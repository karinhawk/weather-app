## About <a name = "about"></a>

A weather app built in React which uses WeatherApi to render weather forecasts for specified locations. The user can check their local weather using their device's coordinates or they can search for a location. A 7 day forecast for a location will be displayed, but a daily forecast can be displayed if a day is clicked on. The user can switch between temperature units (F or C).
